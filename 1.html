    <h1>wasted poem</h1>
    <h2>(30.12.2019)</h2>
    <p>
      16 years old, the birth of work<br />
      no two ways in a rational world<br />
      think through time burning wings<br />
      harping along a scrupulous machine<br />
      reap the worth of bountiful time<br />
      pride and fun in sewing rhymes<br />
      cut the fabric that clothes all love<br />
      to chase the dream that soon becomes<br />
      a two page letter and wisdom plans<br />
      that burn all days through weary hands<br />
      now what was said once is buried soon<br />
      the act of reason is a surface fool<br />
      a brain that worked into overtime<br />
      now aloof and scared to prick what's king<br />
      maybe one day there will be a new year<br />
      where all the tears will let us sleep<br />
    </p>
  </body>
